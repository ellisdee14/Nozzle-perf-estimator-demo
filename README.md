## 📄 Description

Welcome to the Nozzle-perf-estimator-demo! This application provides a simple way to estimate the performance of rocket nozzles. It calculates the exit state variables, including Mach number (Me), pressure (Pe), temperature (Te), thrust coefficient (CF), specific impulse (Isp), thrust-to-area ratio (F/At), and conducts useful Pc–area-ratio sweeps. 

Built in pure Python, this tool is lightweight and suitable for quick trade studies. All results can be easily exported to CSV files for further analysis. This makes it an excellent choice for engineers and enthusiasts in the field of rocket propulsion and gas dynamics.

## 🚀 Features

- Calculates key nozzle performance metrics
- Supports analysis with isentropic flow conditions
- Outputs results in CSV format for easy data handling
- Requires Python 3.10 or later
- Ideal for educational purposes and engineering tasks

## 🌐 Topics

- Aerothermodynamics
- Compressible Flow
- Engineering
